    <p>
      Filters, including bulk filters and exclude fiters, can be applied
      to pinboards just as with tables and charts. These kinds of
      filters apply to an entire pinboard, making it easy to see only
      the data that you are interested in across the tables and charts
      within a pinboard.

    <title>When to use a pinboard filter</title>
    <p>
      Pinboard filters can be very useful when you want to apply the
      same filters to more than one related visualization. You can
      narrow the focus of your pinboard for specific purposes or
      audiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you apply a filter, the pinboard is not automatically saved
      with your filter applied. This is to encourage ad hoc filtering.
      Therefore, people with read-only access can create pinboard
      filters. You must have edit access to the pinboard, and view
      access (or higher) to the underlying data source in order save a
      pinboard filter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that pinboard filters only apply to the tables and charts
      that are based on worksheets. If a pinboard also includes tables
      and charts that were created from underlying tables or on user
      uploaded data, the filters donâ€™t apply to them.

      You can create a filter in the pinboard view for any pinboard.
      This allows you to easily manipulate the visualizations and view
      the modified presentation in one place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is an example that shows you how to add a single filter to a
      pinboard. To create a pinboard filter:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Click the ellipses icon ![more options menu icon]({{
          site.baseurl }}/images/icon-ellipses.png){: .inline}, and
          select <i>Add filters</i>.
        </p>
        <fig id="fig_1580796170_1"><title>Add filters under Actions</title><image href="https://docs.thoughtspot.com/6.0/images/add_pinboard_filters.png" id="image_1580796170_1" scope="external"/></fig>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In the populated columns menu, click the
          <i>Add filter</i> icon next to the
          column you would like to filter on.
        </p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Select the values to include in your answer.
        </p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If you want to exclude values, click
          <i>Exclude</i> and choose values
          to exclude.
        </p>
        <fig id="fig_1580796170_4"><title>Exclude column filters value box</title><image href="https://docs.thoughtspot.com/6.0/images/exclude_nulls.png" id="image_1580796170_4" scope="external"/></fig>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Click <i>Done</i>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      When you apply a filter, the pinboard is not automatically saved
      with your filter applied to every object in the pinboard that was
      created from a worksheet. Pinboard filters do not apply to tables
      and charts built directly on top of base tables.

    <p>
      Your applied filter will sit at the top of the pinboard, where you
      can edit it in place:
