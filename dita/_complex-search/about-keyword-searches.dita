      }}/reference/keywords.html#) section or in the help. Open the help
      by selecting <i>Help</i> from the top

    <title>Example: Simplify search with the top keyword</title>
    <p>
      The <codeph>top</codeph> keyword can be a powerful addition to
      your search when you remember to use it. By using one keyword, you
      can greatly simplify your searches. The top keyword is one such
      keyword. Its syntax looks like top n for each x.

    <title>Types of keywords</title>
    <p>
      Keywords serve a variety of predefined purposes, and are divided
      into different groups. The groups are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <i>Basic keywords</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use keywords such as <codeph>top</codeph> and
          <codeph>bottom</codeph> to, for example, only see results
          for the best or worst performing sales rep.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <i>Date keywords</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Date keywords give you the freedom to narrow your search by
          days, weeks, months, quarters, or years. There are also a
          number of date related keywords such as
          <codeph>after</codeph>, <codeph>before</codeph>, and
          <codeph>year-over-year</codeph>. Use the new date keywords
          to describe dates in the future. This is useful for exploring
          things that are scheduled for a future date, such as shipments
          due to go out in the next week.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <i>Time keywords</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Time keywords are the most useful when trying to figure out
          how many visitors you've received within the last
          <codeph>n minutes or hours</codeph>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <i>Text keywords</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use text keywords to find similar words or phrases
          that contains a certain word. For example,
          <codeph>product name contains green</codeph>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <i>Number keywords</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          These keywords allows you to define your search by sum,
          average, count, max, min, and other accumulations.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <i>Comparative keywords</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Filter keywords work in the same way as filters on table
          columns or chart axes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <i>Location keywords</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          The keywords <codeph>near</codeph> and
          <codeph>farther than</codeph> allow you to search with
          spatial filters on your geo type columns with
          latitude/longitude data. This lets you focus your search based
          on distance and locations. You can specify a specific radius
          using miles, kilometers, or meters.
