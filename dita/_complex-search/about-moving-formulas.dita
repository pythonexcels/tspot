    <title>Moving functions</title>
    <p>
      Moving formulas can be used to smooth out any irregularities in
      your data to easily recognize trends. The larger the interval you
      set, the more the peaks and valleys are smoothed out. While the
      smaller the interval, the closer the moving averages are to the
      actual data points.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of the moving formula accepts a measure, two integers to
      define the window, and one or more optional attributes.
    </p>
    <programlisting>
formula (measure,integer,integer,[attribute,attribute,...])
</programlisting>
    <p>
      Only the measure and integer values are required. If you supply
      both required and optional values, the formula returns the
      aggregate of the measure over the given window. You should
      experiment with only a measure and integers leaving out the
      attribute and then adding it back in. This will help you decide
      which output best meets your use case.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moving formulas are the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <codeph>moving_average</codeph>, for example
          <codeph>moving_average (revenue, 2, 1, customer region)</codeph>
        </p>
        <p>
          Takes a measure, two integers to define the window to
          aggregate over, and one or more attributes. Returns the
          average of the measure over the given window. The attributes
          are the ordering columns used to compute the moving average.
          The window is
          (<codeph>current - Num1...Current + Num2</codeph>) with both
          end points being included in the window. For example,
          <codeph>1,1</codeph> will have a window size of 3. To see
          periods in the past, use a negative number for the second
          endpoint, as in the example
          <codeph>moving_average(sales, 1, -1, date)</codeph>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <codeph>moving_max</codeph>, for example
          <codeph>moving_max (complaints, 1, 2, store name)</codeph>
        </p>
        <p>
          Takes a measure, two integers to define the window to
          aggregate over, and one or more attributes. Returns the
          maximum of the measure over the given window. The attributes
          are the ordering columns used to compute the moving maximum.
          The window is (current - Num1...Current + Num2) with both end
          points being included in the window. For example,
          <codeph>1,1</codeph> will have a window size of 3. To see
          periods in the past, use a negative number for the second
          endpoint, as in the example
          <codeph>moving_max(sales, 1, -1, date)</codeph>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <codeph>moving_min</codeph>, for example
          <codeph>moving_min (defects, 3, 1, product)</codeph>
        </p>
        <p>
          Takes a measure, two integers to define the window to
          aggregate over, and one or more attributes. Returns the
          minimum of the measure over the given window. The attributes
          are the ordering columns used to compute the moving minimum.
          The window is (current - Num1...Current + Num2) with both end
          points being included in the window. For example,
          <codeph>1,1</codeph> will have a window size of 3. To see
          periods in the past, use a negative number for the second
          endpoint, as in the example
          <codeph>moving_min(sales, 1, -1, date)</codeph>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <codeph>moving_sum</codeph>, for example
          <codeph>moving_sum (revenue, 1, 1, order date)</codeph>
        </p>
        <p>
          Takes a measure, two integers to define the window to
          aggregate over, and one or more attributes. Returns the sum of
          the measure over the given window. The attributes are the
          ordering columns used to compute the moving sum. The window is
          (current - Num1...Current + Num2) with both end points being
          included in the window. For example, <codeph>1,1</codeph>
          will have a window size of 3. To see periods in the past, use
          a negative number for the second endpoint, as in the example
          <codeph>moving_sum(sales, 1, -1, date)</codeph>.

      This example demonstrates using the
      <codeph>moving_average</codeph> formula. To use the moving
      function in a search:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Start a new search.
        </p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In the upper-right side of the table, click the ellipses icon
          ![more options menu icon]({{ site.baseurl
          }}/images/icon-ellipses.png){: .inline} and select
          <i>Add formula</i>.

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Enter the moving_average formula, providing a measure, a
          window, and one or more attributes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The example will return the average of revenue, within the
          commit date window size of 3. The window includes the
          previous, current, and next rows. The attributes are the
          ordering columns used to compute the moving average. The
          window is (current - Num1...Current + Num2) with both end
          points being included in the window. For example,
          "1,1" will have a window size of 3. To see periods
          in the past, use a negative number for the second endpoint, as
          in the example "moving_average(sales, 1, -1, date)".

      <li>
        <p>
          Name the formula by entering a title in the top field, and
          then click <i>Save</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The formula will appear in the search bar and in the table as
          its own column.

        <p>
          A box displaying the moving average within the entire table
          will appear at the bottom.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          To use a different aggregation type, click the current
          aggregation type in the bottom of the box and select another
          type.
