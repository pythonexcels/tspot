    <title>"What are Searches and Answers?"</title>
    <p>
      Using ThoughtSpot's relational search is simple, so anyone can use
      it. In the search bar, type what you are interested in exploring,
      for example <codeph>revenue midwest sales rep</codeph>. Searches
      return a set of results in the form of a table or a chart.
      ThoughtSpot likes to call this set of results in response to a
      search an <i>answer</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you get better with ThoughtSpot's search, you will be able to
      get more out of your data by performing more complex searches.
      There are a few basic things you should understand before starting
      a new ThoughtSpot search.

    <title>How do I search data?</title>
    <p>
      You’ve probably seen one of these before:
    </p>
    <fig id="fig_1580796174_1"><title>Search bar</title><image href="https://docs.thoughtspot.com/6.0/images/search_bar_blank.png" id="image_1580796174_1" scope="external"/></fig>
    <p>
      Click in the box and start typing some letters. As soon as you
      begin typing, ThoughtSpot suggests some search terms Type slowly
      and use the suggestions to find what you're looking for.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can see an answer in the form of a chart or a table. If you do
      not see an answer, press <i>Enter</i>
      on your keyboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should know that search in ThoughtSpot is more like an Amazon
      search than a conversation. For example. Instead of:
    </p>
    <programlisting>
Find me all books by Lewis Carroll with the title Alice in Wonderland
</programlisting>
    <p>
      You'd type:
    </p>
    <programlisting>
carroll alice
</programlisting>
    <p>
      Or consider Google. You wouldn’t type in:
    </p>
    <programlisting>
Find me the largest city by population
</programlisting>
    <p>
      You’d type:
    </p>
    <programlisting>
largest city by population
</programlisting>
    <p>
      or simply:
    </p>
    <programlisting>
largest city population
</programlisting>
    <p>
      That’s how search works in ThoughtSpot. You can use some helping
      words like “by” and “for” but they can also be left out, and the
      search will return the same answer.

    <p>
      Search is based on the tables that exist in your data. Tables are
      made of rows and columns, like spreadsheets. So you can search by
      typing in any of these words:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The column name: like revenue, product name, or store
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Any of the values in the columns: like 20000, kitten chow, or
          richmond
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          One of the special [keywords]({{ site.baseurl
          }}/reference/keywords.html#) ThoughtSpot understands: like
          yesterday, &gt;, or contains
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section id="save-an-answer">
    <title>Save an answer</title>
    <p>
      An answer is the result of a single search. You can save an answer
      you want to work more on later, or just keep it for your personal
      use. You can also share an answer with other users. The
      <i>Answers</i> tab is where you can
      view and then the your saved search results.
