    <title>Usage-based ranking (UBR)</title>
    <p>
      Search suggestions are relevant to the data and personalized to
      your search behavior. ThoughtSpot learns over time what columns
      are most important to you and to your company as a whole. Then, it
      uses this knowledge to rank the search terms it offers. The term
      for this is usage-based ranking (UBR).
    </p>
    <p>
      ThoughtSpot keeps usage statistics on frequency of search terms in
      its local cache. If you frequently use type terms related to
      finance or to a particular product, ThoughtSpot provides you with
      related suggestions more frequently. Using this information,
      frequently used terms and phrases are offered in search
      suggestions more often than those that are not commonly used.
    </p>
    <p>
      UBR based on search patterns makes ThoughtSpot more valuable over
      time. Search suggestions become more helpful the more searches you
      complete.

      As you type in the search bar, you are given search suggestions
      that include recent searches. This makes it easier to learn what
      you can do with ThoughtSpot. In addition to displaying your own
      recent searches, the search bar also learns from searches made by
      other people. This should provide you with interesting searches
      that you may not have been aware of. You can see recent searches
      in a separate section of search suggestions, as recent searches
      appear higher in suggestions than other terms.

      When there are more than one possible meaning for a search term,
      you can provide disambiguation by selecting from a list of
      choices. Now, your choice is sticky. That means you wonâ€™t have to
      select it again, in the scope of the current search.

    <title>Out of scope columns</title>
    <p>
      Search suggestions are not limited in scope to the columns that
      you select as the data sources. Suggestions can include columns
      that are out of scope, too. If you choose one of these
      suggestions, the columns will be added to the data sources scope
      for you.

      Search suggestions also include relevant pinboards that have
      already been created. This means that if a pinboard that is
      similar to the search you're trying to do already exists, it will
      appear in search suggestions.
