    <title>About R in ThoughtSpot</title>
    <p>
      R is a popular open source programming language for statistical
      computing, machine learning, and AI. ThoughtSpot makes R analysis
      available as a fully integrated feature.

      default. To turn on custom R scripting, contact your site

    <title>Using R in ThoughtSpot</title>
    <p>
      Users with R privileges can run R scripts directly on search
      results.
    </p>
    <p>
      Analysts and data scientists who are proficient in R can create
      and share custom scripts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Users can leverage custom scripts and ThoughtSpot provided
      scripts, run pre-built R scripts on top of their search results,
      and share R visualizations as answers and pinboards.
    </p>
    <p>
      This topic explains how to use R in ThoughtSpot both from an end
      user and scripting perspective, but is not meant as an R primer.

      Users with R script privileges can click the
      <i>R</i> icon ![R icon]({{
      site.baseurl }}/images/r-icon-inline.png){: .inline} on the
      toolbar for any search result (answer).
    </p>
    <p>
      ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/r-icon.png)
    </p>
    <p>
      From here, you have options to write a custom script, or load a
      pre-built or ThoughtSpot provided script.

    <p>
      You don't have to have a background in statistics or be an R
      programmer to run R analyses in ThoughtSpot. You can use
      ThoughtSpot-provided scripts and share the R visualizations with
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more on how to run provided scripts, skip to [Run pre-built R

    <title>Write your own R scripts in ThoughtSpot</title>
    <p>
      If you know R, you can write your own custom scripts, share them
      as templates, test and run them on your data in ThoughtSpot, and
      build up a shared library of R analyses, scripts, visualizations,
      and pinboards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Start with the topic on how to [Create and share R scripts]({{
      site.baseurl }}/end-user/r-scripts/create-r-scripts.html) to learn
      more about writing R scripts in ThoughtSpot, including a few
      particulars on syntax and column bindings.

      To learn more about R programming in general, a good place to
      start is <link href="https://www.r-project.org/">R Project

      <link href="https://www.thoughtspot.com/codex/using-r-analysis-thoughtspot-time-series-forecasting">Using
      R Analysis in ThoughtSpot for Time Series Forecasting</link> is a
      nice introduction to writing R scripts in ThoughtSpot.
