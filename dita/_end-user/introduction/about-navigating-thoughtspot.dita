      These are the different sections in ThoughtSpot:

    <title>Home</title>
    <p>
      Click the ThoughtSpot logo to go to the application home page. At
      the top of the home page you can see a search bar, and several
      areas that show activity in ThoughtSpot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The items shown in these areas are limited to answers, pinboards,
      worksheets, and other objects you have access to. For example, if
      you don't have the ability to use SpotIQ, that option does not
      appear.
    </p>
    </section>
  <section id="search">
    <title>Search</title>
    <p>
      <i>Search</i> is where you will spend
      most of your time. It allows you to search and explore your data.
      Choose your data sources and type in the search bar at the top. As
      you type your search, results will appear in the main part of the
      screen as either a table or a chart.
    </p>
    <p>
      If SearchIQ (<i>Beta</i>) is enabled
      by your administrator, this label is
      <i>Search+</i>, to differentiate it
      from SearchIQ. Use the search bar on the homepage to use SearchIQ.

  <section id="answers">
    <title>Answers</title>
    <p>
      Answers are the result of a single search. You can save an answer
      you want to work more on later, or just keep it for your personal
      use. Answers are for you alone, until you share them with others.
    </p>
    </section>
  <section id="pinboards">
    <title>Pinboards</title>
    <p>
      Pinboards are collections of related search results. You can
      create your own pinboard or add to an existing one. After saving a
      pinboard, it can be shared with others or viewed as a slideshow.
      The <i>Pinboards</i> page shows a list
      of saved pinboards. Click one to view, edit, or share it.

      managed by your administrator. However, you may be able to import
      a spreadsheet (Excel or CSV) here, if you have the correct
      privileges.
