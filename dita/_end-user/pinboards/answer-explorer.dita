    <title>title: Answer Explorer summary: Answer Explorer provides you
    with AI-guided exploration of Answers within Pinboards, so you can
    more easily find valuable and actionable information inside your
    data. last_updated: 1/24/2020 sidebar: mydoc_sidebar permalink:

    <p>
      Answer Explorer, ThoughtSpot's AI-guided exploration of Answers
      within Pinboards, provides you with valuable suggestions on how to
      explore and understand your data, based on two main criteria. The
      Answer Explorer AI considers both popularity and personalization.
      The feature suggests ways to answer questions that are relevant to
      many other users, and it takes into account your own ThoughtSpot
      history. Answer Explorer helps you better understand your data and
      get to actionable insights faster with just a click.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can access Answer Explorer from any Answer in a Pinboard.
      Click the <i>Explore</i> button that
      appears when you hover over any Answer.
    </p>
    <fig id="fig_1580796177_1"><title>The Explore button</title><image href="https://docs.thoughtspot.com/6.0/images/explore-button.png" id="image_1580796177_1" scope="external"/></fig>
    <p>
      The Answer expands to fill your screen, and the
      <i>Explore this data</i> menu appears.
    </p>
    <fig id="fig_1580796177_2"><title>Explore this data</title><image href="https://docs.thoughtspot.com/6.0/images/explore-fullscreen.png" id="image_1580796177_2" scope="external"/></fig>
    <p>
      You can explore your data in several different ways, using
      [filters]({{ site.baseurl }}#explore-filters), [breakdowns]({{
      site.baseurl }}#explore-breakdowns), [metrics]({{ site.baseurl
      }}#explore-metrics), or [comparisons]({{ site.baseurl
      }}#explore-comparisons).
    </p>
    <p>
      Answer Explorer's AI updates its suggestions every time you add
      something new to your visualization. If you add a suggested
      filter, Answer Explorer then suggests new filters, breakdowns,
      metrics, and comparisons, based on that new filter in your chart.
    </p>
    </section>
  <section id="filters">
    <title>Filters</title>
    <p>
      Use the <i>Filters</i> search bar to
      filter your data. Answer Explorer uses sophisticated technology to
      show only the most relevant suggestions. Click
      <i>Add</i> to add a suggested filter
      to your visualization. You can click <i>Show
      more</i> to see even more suggestions.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to filter on a column value that Answer Explorer did
      not suggest, you can search for it in the
      <i>Filters</i> search bar. Specify the
      column values you wish to see, such as <i>Age
      group=65+</i>, and press
      <i>Enter</i>.
    </p>
    </section>
  <section id="breakdowns">
    <title>Breakdowns</title>
    <p>
      Use <i>Breakdowns</i> to visualize
      your data, separated by an attribute. For example, break by
      <i>Store State</i> to see which states have the best
      sales. If your Answer has a time attribute, you can easily change
      from <i>daily</i> to <i>quarterly</i>,
      and so on.
    </p>
    <fig id="fig_1580796177_3"><title>Break by store state</title><image href="https://docs.thoughtspot.com/6.0/images/explore-breakdown.png" id="image_1580796177_3" scope="external"/></fig>
    <p>
      After you make a change to your Answer, you may want to go back to
      an earlier version of your Answer. You can click the Back icon
      ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-arrow-left-20px.png){: .inline}
      to go back one step, or the Reset icon ![]({{ site.baseurl
      }}/images/icon-reset-20px.png){: .inline} to go back to the
      original answer.
    </p>
    </section>
  <section id="metrics">
    <title>Metrics</title>
    <p>
      Use <i>Metrics</i> to add other
      available measures. For example, you can add <i>gross
      profit margin</i> to view both sales and gross profit
      margin by store region.
    </p>
    <fig id="fig_1580796177_4"><title>Sales and gross profit margin</title><image href="https://docs.thoughtspot.com/6.0/images/explore-metrics.png" id="image_1580796177_4" scope="external"/></fig>
    <p>
      If you want to see <i>gross profit margin</i>
      instead of <i>sales</i>, click
      <i>Show more</i> and select
      <i>Change sales to gross profit
      margin</i>.
    </p>
    <fig id="fig_1580796177_5"><title>Gross profit margin by store region</title><image href="https://docs.thoughtspot.com/6.0/images/explore-metricsprofit.png" id="image_1580796177_5" scope="external"/></fig>
    </section>
  <section id="comparisons">
    <title>Comparisons</title>
    <p>
      Use <i>Comparisons</i> to easily
      perform a <i>versus</i> analysis. For example,
      Answer Explorer might suggest you compare your best- and
      worst-performing products.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="drill-down-with-answer-explorer">
    <title>Drill down with Answer Explorer</title>
    <p>
      You can Drill down from within Answer Explorer. When you Drill
      down in Answer Explorer, you have the option of going back one
      step at a time, using the Back icon ![]({{ site.baseurl
      }}/images/icon-arrow-left-20px.png){: .inline}. You cannot go back
      one step at a time if you Drill down on an Answer in a Pinboard,
      without using Answer Explorer.
    </p>
    <p>
      See [Drill down]({{ site.baseurl
      }}/complex-search/drill-down.html).
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="save-your-new-answer">
    <title>Save your new answer</title>
    <p>
      When you find a valuable insight using Answer Explorer, you may
      want to save that Answer as it appears, instead of trying to
      recreate it in the <i>Search</i> bar.
    </p>
    <ol spacing="compact">
      <li>
        <p>
          Click the ellipsis icon ![]({{ site.baseurl
          }}/images/icon-more-20px.png){: .inline}.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Select <i>copy and edit</i>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <i>Save</i> your new Answer within
          ThoughtSpot and continue working with it.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Alternatively, select
          <i>Download</i> to download an
          image of your current visualization.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      You can also <i>pin</i> the current
      Answer to any Pinboard you have
      <i>edit</i> access to. Click the
      <i>pin</i> icon ![]({{ site.baseurl
      }}/images/icon-pin.png){: .inline} and select a Pinboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Otherwise, the Answer returns to its original state when you exit
      the <i>Explore</i> menu by clicking
      the <i>X</i> icon.
