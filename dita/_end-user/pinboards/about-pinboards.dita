    <title>Basic pinboard usage</title>
    <p>
      Pinboards act like live dashboards. They are collections of your
      related charts, tables, and headline.

    <title>What are pinboards</title>
    <p>
      You can pin charts and tables to any pinboard which you created,
      and those that have been shared with you with the
      <i>Edit</i> privilege. When you create
      a pinboard, you can share it with other people with either the
      <i>View</i> or
      <i>Edit</i> privilege. Pinboards are
      interactive, allowing you to perform actions like filtering,
      excluding values, and drill down on the visualizations.

      You can download a pinboard as a PDF file, without having to
      download each visualization separately. Downloading a pinboard
      works just as it would when downloading an answer: simply click
      the ellipses icon ![more options menu icon]({{ site.baseurl
      }}/images/icon-ellipses.png){: .inline} and select
      <i>Download as PDF</i>.

    <title>Details about a pinboard</title>
    <p>
      You can see who authored a pinboard, when it was created, and when
      it was last modified by choosing <i>Actions
      &gt; Pinboard Info</i>.
    </p>
    <p>

  <section id="other-pinboard-actions">
    <title>Other pinboard actions</title>
    <p>
      Other pinboard actions include actions you normally perform on
      your search as well as actions that you can only perform on a
      pinboard. Most of these actions are found under the
      <i>Actions</i> button.
    </p>
    <fig id="fig_1580796177_6"><title>Pinboard actions button</title><image href="https://docs.thoughtspot.com/6.0/images/pinboard_actions.png" id="image_1580796177_6" scope="external"/></fig>
    <p>
      Other actions are available on a pinboard display itself. Some
      actions always appear, while others appear only when you hover
      over specific locations of the pinboard. This diagram displays
      active action areas on a pinboard.

    <p>
      If you make a change to a pinboard, the system recognizes this and
      displays an alert message with a <i>Save
      changes</i> button at the top of the page. Click this
      button to make your changes permanent.
