    <p>
      When you begin using ThoughtSpot, the onboarding process starts
      automatically and guides you through a few basic scenarios.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually, you receive an email welcoming you to the onboarding
      process at ThoughtSpot.

    <p>
      To repeat user onboarding, see [Revisit onboarding]({{

      <i><i>[Optional]</i></i>
      Any user can repeat their onboarding experience at any time.
      Simply select <i>Profile</i> from the
      user icon on the top right corner of the page, and under
      <i>Preferences &gt; New user
      onboarding</i>, click <i>Revisit
      Onboarding</i>. See [Revisit onboarding]({{ site.baseurl
      }}/end-user/introduction/about-user.html#onboarding).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are a new user and you did not experience onboarding,
      please contact your administrator and request that they configure
      it for you and other new users.
    </p>

      You can always get additional help. As you start to use
      ThoughtSpot, we recommend that you review [Getting Started]({{
