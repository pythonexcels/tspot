Filters, including bulk filters and exclude fiters, can be applied to pinboards just as with tables
and charts. These kinds of filters apply to an entire pinboard, making it easy
to see only the data that you are interested in across the tables and charts
within a pinboard.

## When to use a pinboard filter

Pinboard filters can be very useful when you want to apply the same filters to
more than one related visualization. You can narrow the focus of your pinboard
for specific purposes or audiences.

When you apply a filter, the pinboard is not automatically saved with your
filter applied. This is to encourage ad hoc filtering. Therefore, people with
read-only access can create pinboard filters. You must have edit access to the
pinboard, and view access (or higher) to the underlying data source in order
save a pinboard filter.

Note that pinboard filters only apply to the tables and charts that are based on
worksheets. If a pinboard also includes tables and charts that were created from
underlying tables or on user uploaded data, the filters donâ€™t apply to them.

## Create a pinboard filter

You can create a filter in the pinboard view for any pinboard. This allows you
to easily manipulate the visualizations and view the modified presentation in
one place.

Here is an example that shows you how to add a single filter to a pinboard. To
create a pinboard filter:

1. Click the ellipses icon ![more options menu icon]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-ellipses.png){: .inline}, and select **Add filters**.

     ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/add_pinboard_filters.png "Add filters under Actions")

2. In the populated columns menu, click the **Add filter** icon next to the column you would like to filter on.

     ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/add_filters_menu.png "Add filters menu")

3. Select the values to include in your answer.

     ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/column_filter.png "Include column filters value box")

4. If you want to exclude values, click **Exclude** and choose values to exclude.

     ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/exclude_nulls.png "Exclude column filters value box")

5. Click **Done**.

  When you apply a filter, the pinboard is not automatically saved with your
  filter applied to every object in the pinboard that was created from a
  worksheet. Pinboard filters do not apply to tables and charts built directly on
  top of base tables.

## Edit a filter from the answer

Your applied filter will sit at the top of the pinboard, where you can edit it in place:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/select_filters.png "Select Filter Values")

Or delete it:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/filter_appears.png "Applied Pinboard Filter")
