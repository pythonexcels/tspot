You can always go back and view or edit a formula that was added to a search. Do this by clicking the edit icon next to its name in the **Columns** listing. Anyone who has edit privileges on an answer can also edit any formulas it contains. To view or edit an existing formula in an answer:

1. Navigate to the pinboard that contains the answer with the formula, click the three-dot **Actions** icon and select **Edit**.
2. Scroll down to the bottom of the **Columns** listing. You will see a data source called **Formulas**.
3. Expand **Formulas**, and you can see a list of all the formulas in this answer.

6. If you edited your formula, click **Save** to save your changes. Otherwise, click **Cancel**.
