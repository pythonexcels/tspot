You can create a bulk filter on a saved search. You create the filter by
pasting a list of values, separated by commas, semicolons, new lines, or tabs,
into the bulk filter box. A filter allows you to easily search a large list of
values repeatedly.

Your filter can have up to 10k values in it. When you add a filter, the system
does not check that the value exists in the data. This allows you to anticipate
values that _may be_ added in your filter.

Before you can create a bulk filter, you must have **Can edit** permission on
the table or worksheet. In this example, you will cut and paste values to create
a bulk filter. You could also get a list of text values from another
application such as an email or cells from an Excel or Google Sheets
spreadsheet.

1. In table view, select multiple cells by clicking and dragging.
2. Right-click and choose **Copy to clipboard**.

3. Hover over the column header you want to filter, and click the **three-dot icon (ellipses)** icon.

4. Choose whether you want your bulk filter to **Include** or **Exclude** values.

5. Click **Add values in bulk**:
