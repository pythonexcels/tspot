The pie chart is a classic chart type that displays your search in a circle. The default pie chart in ThoughtSpot displays data in the shape of a doughnut, or a thick ring.

## How pie charts divide data

Pie charts divide your data into sectors that each represent a proportion of a whole circle. You can display the exact values of each slice, in addition to the percentage values by toggling on **Additional chart options** found under Change chart configuration.

Your search needs at least one attribute and one measure to be represented as a pie chart. Also, there must be fewer than 50 values in the attribute column.

## Pie in pie charts

The pie in pie chart can be created from a regular pie chart in order to compare more than one component of an attribute. Pie in pie charts show two concentric pie charts comparing different measures.

To see a pie in pie chart, assign two different measures to the y-axis under **Configure Chart**.
