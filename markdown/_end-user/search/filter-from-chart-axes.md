You can filter a chart in two ways:

1.  Click the legend labels to toggle the values on or off.
2.  Follow the steps shown here to filter on the axis values.

To add a filter from the chart axes:

1. While viewing your answer as a chart, click the chart axis you want to filter on, and select **Filter...**.

2. Select the values you would like to include in your answer.

3. If you want to exclude values, click **Exclude** and choose values to exclude.

4. Click **DONE**.

If there are too many values, you can use the filter search bar to find the ones you want.
