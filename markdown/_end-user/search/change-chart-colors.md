To change the colors used in a chart, use the color picker on the chart styles
panel. You can set colors for:

* bars, lines, areas, bubbles, maps, and other visuals on charts
* legends on charts
* tables for conditional formatting
* tags and editing the colors

To change the chart colors, you need at least one column in the chart's legend.
If the chart does not have a legend (not all do) and it is a single-measure
chart, you can [apply a conditional format]({{site.baseurl}}/end-user/search/apply-conditional-formatting.html) to
change the color. This type of conditional formatting does not work with Line
charts.

Colors are maintained across searches within a session. For example, when doing
a search on revenue by state, each state will keep its color assigned to it even
if you change the search or chart type.

## Set colors on a chart

1. While viewing your search or answer as a chart, click **Edit chart styles** (![paintbrush icon]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-paintbrush.png){: .inline}) to open the Styles panel.

2. On the chart, click the color icon of the label or legend value you would like to change the color of.

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/legend.png "Legend values list")

2. Use the color picker to choose a new color to represent that value.

   You can also enter a HEX value directly.
