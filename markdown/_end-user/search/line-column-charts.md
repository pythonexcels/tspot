The line column chart combines the column and line charts. Your search needs at least one attribute and two measures to be represented as a line column chart.


## Understand line column charts

Line column charts display one measure as a column chart and the other as a line chart. Each of these measures has its own y-axis.

## Line stacked column charts

This chart is similar to the line column chart, except that it divides its columns with an attribute in the legend. There are two y-axes, one for each measure.
