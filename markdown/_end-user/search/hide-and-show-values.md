Clicking on a legend item will hide it from the chart. You can click it again to show it. To hide and show values:

1. While viewing your answer as a chart, click **Edit chart configuration** on the right.

2. Make sure you have a column in the **Legend** field.

3. On the chart, click the legend value you would like to hide. Click the hidden legend value again to show it.
