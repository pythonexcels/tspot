You can apply conditional formatting to tables or charts to highlight values in
the data. This makes values above, below, or within a particular threshold stand
out.

You can add visual cues for KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) or threshold
metrics to charts and tables, to easily show where you are falling short or
exceeding targets. These visual cues are called conditional formatting, which
applies color formatting to your search result. For tables, you can add
conditional formatting to set the background color of cells in a table based on
the values they contain. For charts, you can add conditional formatting to show
the threshold(s) you defined, and the data that falls within them will be shown
using the same color.

Many companies create pinboards with key metrics they want to track in daily or
weekly staff meetings. Using conditional formatting, they can see at a glance how
they are performing relative to these metrics.
