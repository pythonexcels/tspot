When a user struggles to answer a specific question, build a chart you have in mind, or find something in the data, they can use **Ask an expert** to request help. The request will go to the designated expert for the data source they were searching. The user will be able to see the result in the **Answers** listing in ThoughtSpot.

## How do I answer a question from Ask an Expert?

1. You receive an email stating that your help is needed, with a link to the request.  
   If you do not have an email set up in ThoughtSpot, you must do this to check for requests:
   1. Log in to ThoughtSpot.
   2. Click **Answers** in the top menu.
   3. On the top right hand side, click the ellipses and choose **View Requested Answers**. You can see a listing of all requests for help.

2. When you choose a request to answer, you can see the answer the user was working on. You are now in "expert mode". If the user provided an explanation of what they were looking for, you can see that under the visualization.

3. Work on the answer until it looks like what the user wanted to see. Then click **Close**.

4. If the requester has an email address in ThoughtSpot, an email will be sent to them with a link to the answer. If not, you must share a link to the answer with them using email or a direct message. A link to the answer is provided, so you can easily share the answer.

6. If you want to see the answer again, you can find it listed along with the other answers. Click **Answers** in the top menu to see the list of saved answers.
