You can perform many of the same search actions on individual visualizations within a pinboard as you can within a search. You can interact directly with a visualization of a pinboard to perform ad hoc searches or edit it. These search actions include the following:

-   Editing a search - You can edit the original search and reconfigure the answer. Click the three-dot **Actions** button to the upper-right of your visualization and select **Edit**.

     ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/edit_a_pinboard_visualization.png "Edit a pinboard visualization")

    You will now be in edit mode, where you can [view and change sources]({{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/search/about-choosing-sources.html#), [search different columns]({{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/search/about-the-search-bar.html#), [change the view]({{ site.baseurl }}/complex-search/change-the-view.html#), [save the answer as a worksheet]({{ site.baseurl }}/complex-search/about-query-on-query.html), [add a formula]({{ site.baseurl }}/complex-search/add-formula-to-search.html#), and [change the chart]({{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/search/change-the-chart.html#).
