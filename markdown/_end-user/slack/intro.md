Slack is an enterprise software platform that allows teams to communicate
effectively through a messaging application. Slack also allows users to
communicate with applications like ThoughtSpot through chat.

Spot is a ThoughtSpot integration with Slack.

## Does your Slack have Spot?

Spot has to be integrated with your Slack team before you can use it. Your team
admin or ThoughtSpot admin can do this. To test if your Slack team has a Spot
integration, mention <strong>&#64;spot</strong> and see if he barks back:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/slack-0.png "Check for slack")

In this particular channel, <strong>&#64;spot</strong> is there for you but like
his brothers <strong>&#64;spot-east-credit</strong> is not in the channel.

If <strong>&#64;spot</strong> doesn’t come when you “call” you are spotless. Ask your
administrator to see if you can get one.
